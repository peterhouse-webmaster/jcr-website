This website is written by the students of one college, and is intended to give you some useful information, as well as a small snapshot into Cambridge life. We've only scratched the surface of these topics, however, so here are some other excellent online resources from Cambridge University where you might like to continue your research:  
  

-   The main [Cambridge University undergraduate admissions](http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/?ucam-ref=global-header) website - start here.
-   An online copy of [Cambridge University's Official Prospectus 2020](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/files/publications/uoc_prospectus_2020.pdf) (can also be ordered in paper form).
-   A [complete list of all the Cambridge colleges](https://map.cam.ac.uk/colleges), with links to their websites.
-   The [official Peterhouse website](http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), where you can find more specific information about what subjects can be studied at Peterhouse, admissions requirements and our outreach work.
-   An online copy of the [Peterhouse Official Prospectus](http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Peterhouse_prospectus.pdf).
-   The wonderful people who organise Peterhouse applications, open days and access events are also on twitter! Check out Peterhouse's outreach twitter feed [here](https://twitter.com/Peterhouse_SLO); they'll keep you posted on relevant competitions, cool further reading and all manner of other things to help you apply to university.
